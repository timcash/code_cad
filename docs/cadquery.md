## [CadQuery Documentation Examples](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)

This page contains a wealth of examples, ranging from simple shapes to advanced features. I will select three examples from this page to implement.

1.  **A plate with a hole:** Demonstrates basic shapes and boolean operations.
2.  **Defining an Edge with a Spline:** Shows how to create more complex, organic shapes.
3.  **Shelling To Create Thin features:** A more advanced and practical technique.
